Pandemic Oxygen Locator Web application of Nepal
I worked on this project all alone and was able to publish it at the time of pandemic. I made this application for the benefit of my people in my home country. There was shortage of oxygen cylinders and people were in the state of panic. I developed it so that people can know which place has enough oxygen  and which place has less oxygen. This way they would be able to ask for oxygen cylinders if they needed.

After the development I gave it to social workers and they made a team and updated it. I could not work on it more because I had job at that time. It was a voluntary task.
